GIT COURSE
============
- Introduction
    This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what
    Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier
    for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such
    as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool.
    Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about
    information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid
    becoming confused while using it.
